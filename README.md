# Features

1. Workout Tracking: Users can input details of their workouts, such as the type of activity (running or cycling), distance, duration, and any additional notes.

2. Geolocation: The application utilizes the browser's geolocation API to track the user's current location during a workout. This enables accurate mapping of workout routes.

3. Interactive Map Display: Workouts are displayed on an interactive map using mapping libraries like Leaflet or Google Maps API. Users can view their workout routes, markers, and other relevant information directly on the map.

4. Workout Statistics: The application calculates and displays various statistics for each workout, such as distance covered, duration, pace, and elevation gain (if applicable).

5. Workout History: Users can view a log of their past workouts, including details such as workout type, date, time, distance, and duration. This history provides users with insights into their fitness activities over time.

6. Data Storage: Workouts are stored locally in the browser's storage, allowing users to access their workout history even after closing and reopening the application.

7. Responsive Design: The application is designed to be responsive, ensuring a consistent user experience across different devices and screen sizes.
