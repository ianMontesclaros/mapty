3. Interactive Map Display: Workouts are displayed on an interactive map using the Leaflet library.

4. Workout History: Users can view a log of their past workouts, including their details.

6. Data Storage: Workouts are stored locally in the browser's storage, allowing users to access their workout history even after closing and reopening the application.
